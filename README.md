# 🖼️ Image-Prompted Speech Generation using LLM 🎙️

This Streamlit application transforms any uploaded image into a spoken short story using a blend of vision, language, and voice AI. It combines BLIP for image captioning, GPT-3.5 for creative writing, and HuggingFace TTS for lifelike audio narration—delivering a seamless multimodal storytelling experience.

## 🎯 Project Overview

- 🔍 Extracts a descriptive scenario from an uploaded image using BLIP (image-to-text).
- ✍️ Generates a creative 50-word story from the caption using GPT-3.5 via LangChain.
- 🔊 Converts the story into natural speech using ESPNet’s HuggingFace TTS model.
- 🖼️ Delivered through an interactive Streamlit interface for instant storytelling.
